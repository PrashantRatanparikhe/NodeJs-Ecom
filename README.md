## ShopNode

This peice of code is taken from an e-comm solution built with Node.js. This module is designed for easy integration with your existing applications or to serve as a standalone e-commerce platform. I implement this feature reach module to showcase my expertise in Node, Express, Mongodb, etc.

It contains core e-commerce functionalities like product management, shopping cart, checkout, and order processing.

## **Features**

- **Controllers**: Handle business logic for managing products, orders, customers, etc.
- **Models**: Define the structure of your database entities like Products, Users, Orders, etc.
- **Routes**: Define the application’s routes for handling various HTTP requests such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
- **Views**: User-friendly views/templates that power the front-end of the application, allowing easy interaction with your e-commerce platform.

## **Tech Stack**

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
- **Express**: Web framework for handling HTTP requests and routing.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing products, user data, orders, etc.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Document Mapper) for MongoDB, simplifying database interaction.
- **EJS/Handlebars** (optional): Templating engines for rendering views on the front end.
